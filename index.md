Hi, welcome, blaahh.

## The Hell

This is a blog page of a potato that currently involved in massive typing everyday.

To documenting author's totally unimportant everyday typing is the purpose of this.

Why you ask? (let's assume you did ask) Because even a potato is bigger that author's memory capacity. So much bigger that this rambling produced in hope to save the day when amnesia stroke author (if it's not already happening every morning, assuming the author did sleep instead of procastinating)

## In Case You're Wondering

Should you find useless time or you do need to dig into this potatogrammer's brain, 

You can find more rambling in `Archive`

Or more about the royal potatogrammer in `About`

Go ahead and lookie. No, you're not gonna turn into a potato. More or less...
