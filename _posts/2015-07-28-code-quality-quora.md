## The importance of Code Quality

Some of my fellow programmers out there thinks that it is enough to just code whatever requirements thrown to us. That it is enough that our clients got what they want to do, but is it really as simple as that?

For me, coding is not difficult, everybody can learn it as easy as 1+1, the real meat is on how to develop a healthy habit of designing and writing your codes. Make it easy to read, no matter how short your lines are, one day it will have to be maintained. Make it simple but not to simple, everything that's too simple is wrong and everything that's too complicated is unuseable.

Aside from those philosophical points, I think the most important part is to get feedback from your fellow partners in crime. Most company tend to took code review as something trivia and unimportant, but it's for me, actually is the fastest way to learn from others.

This article from Quora wraps the topic nicely
